### Realignment analysis and additional measures

Here, we include experiments using additional realignment steps (Iso2 and Iso3), and also two additional cluster retrieval performance measures: ARI and misclutering rate (MCR).

### Summary of realignment procedures

#### Iso1

1.  Rank diag(*θ*<sub>*n*</sub>)
2.  Re-order *X*<sub>*n*</sub> and *θ*<sub>*n*</sub> accordintly

#### Iso2

1.  Cluster the centers
2.  Re-assign nodes to clusters based on the center of the centers

#### Iso3

1.  Search over all permutation to make all *W*<sub>*n*</sub> as close as possible
2.  Re-order *X*<sub>*n*</sub> and *θ*<sub>*n*</sub> accordintly
